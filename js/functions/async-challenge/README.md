# Asynchronicity

**Note:** We recommend that after you complete a challenge, you re-comment out the test case for that challenge so the console output is not confusing when working on subsequent challenges.

## Challenge 1

Thinking point (no writing code necessary for this challenge): Inspect the code given to you in Challenge 1. In what order should the console logs come out? ```Howdy``` first or ```Partnah``` first?

## Challenge 2

Create a function ```delayedGreet``` that console logs ```welcome``` after 3 seconds.

## Challenge 3

Create a function ```helloGoodbye``` that console logs ```hello``` right away, and ```good bye``` after 2 seconds.

## Challenge 4

Create a function ```brokenRecord``` that console logs ```hi again``` every second.

## Challenge 5

Create a function ```limitedRepeat``` that console logs ```hi for now``` every second, but only for 5 seconds. Research how to use ```clearInterval``` if you are not sure how to do this.

## Challenge 6

Write a function called ```everyXsecsForYsecs``` that will accept three arguments: a function ```func```, a number ```interval```, and another number ```duration```.

```everyXsecsForYsecs``` will execute the given function every ```interval``` number of milliseconds, but then automatically stop after ```duration``` milliseconds.

Then pass the below ```sayHi``` function into an invocation of ```everyXsecsForYsecs``` with 1000 interval time an 5000 duration time.
What do you expect to happen?

## Challenge 7

Write a function ```delayCounter``` that accepts a number (called 'target') as the first argument and a number of milliseconds (called 'wait') as the second argument, and returns a function.

When the returned function is invoked, it should log to the console all of the numbers between 1 and the target number, spaced apart by 'wait' milliseconds.

## Challenge 8

Write a function, ```promised```, that takes in a value. This function will return a promise that will resolve after 2 seconds.

**Hint:** take a look at the Promise object docs on MDN.

## Challenge 9

Write a ```SecondClock``` class, with two methods: ```start``` and ```reset```.​
**start:** upon invocation, invokes a callback (this.cb, defined in the constructor) on an argument every second, with the argument to the callback being the current seconds "value".

In other words, the callback gets invoked every second on the "seconds hand" of the clock. Always start with 1 and don't utilize the seconds value of the current computer clock time.

* The first "tick" with value 1 occurs 1 second after the initial "secondClock" invocation.

* The second "tick" with value 2 occurs 2 seconds after the initial "secondClock" invocation.

...

* The sixtieth "tick" with value 60 occurs 60 seconds after the initial "secondClock" invocation.

* The sixty-first "tick" with value 1 occurs 61 seconds after the initial "secondClock" invocation.

* The sixty-second "tick" with value 2 occurs 62 seconds after the initial "secondClock" invocation.

etc.

**reset:** upon invocation, completely stops the "clock".
Also resets the time back to the beginning.
​
**Hint:** look up ```setInterval``` and ```clearInterval```.

## Challenge 10

Write a function called ```debounce``` that accepts a function and returns a new function that only allows invocation of the given function after ```interval``` milliseconds have passed since the last time the returned function ran.

Additional calls to the returned function within the ```interval``` time should not be invoked or queued, but the timer should still get reset.
