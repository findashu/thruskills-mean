# Classes and Prototypes (OOP)

* An enormously popular paradigm for structuring our complex code.
* **Prototype chain** - the feature behind-the-scenes that enables emulation of
OOP but is a compelling tool in itself
* Understanding the difference between ```__proto__``` and ```prototype```
* The ```new``` and ```class``` keywords as tools to automate our object & method
creation

## Core of development (and running code)

1. Save data (e.g. in a quiz game the scores of user1 and user2)
2. Run code (functions) using that data (e.g. increase user 2‚Äôs score)
Easy! So why is development hard?
In a quiz game I need to save lots of users, but also admins, quiz questions, quiz
outcomes, league tables - all have data and associated functionality
In 100,000 lines of code
- Where is the functionality when I need it?
- How do I make sure the functionality is only used on the right data!

## That is, I want my code to be:

1. Easy to reason about
But also
2. Easy to add features to (new functionality)
3. Nevertheless efficient and performant

The Object-oriented paradigm aims is to let us achieve these three goals

## So if I‚Äôm storing each user in my app with their respective data (let‚Äôs simplify) 

**user1:**
- name: ‚ÄòTim‚Äô
- score: 3

**user2:**
- name: ‚ÄòStephanie‚Äô
- score: 5

And the functionality I need to have for each user (again simplifying!)
- increment functionality (there‚Äôd be a ton of functions in practice)

How could I store my data and functionality together in one place?

## Objects - store functions with their associated data!

This is the principle of encapsulation - and it‚Äôs going to transform how we can ‚Äòreason about‚Äô our code

```javascript

const user1 = {
 name: "Will",
 score: 3,
 increment: function() { user1.score++; }
};

user1.increment(); //user1.score -> 4
```
Let's keep creating our objects. What alternative techniques do we have for creating objects?

## Creating ```user2``` user dot notation

Declare an empty object and add properties with dot notation

```javascript
const user2 = {}; 
//create an empty object
//assign properties to that object
user2.name = "Tim";
user2.score = 6;
user2.increment = function() {
 user2.score++;
};
```

## Creating ```user3``` using Object.create

Object.create is going to give us fine-grained control over our object later on

```javascript
const user3 = Object.create(null);
user3.name = "Eva";
user3.score = 9;
user3.increment = function() {
 user3.score++;
};

```

Our code is getting repetitive, we're breaking our ```DRY``` principle. And suppose we have millions of users!
What could we do?

## Solution 1. Generate objects using a function (Factory Method)

```javascript
function userCreator(name, score) {
 const newUser = {};
 newUser.name = name;
 newUser.score = score;
 newUser.increment = function() {
 newUser.score++;
 };
 return newUser;
};
const user1 = userCreator("Will", 3);
const user2 = userCreator("Tim", 5);
user1.increment()
```

**Problems:** Each time we create a new user we make space in our computer's
memory for all our data and functions. But our functions are just copies
Is there a better way?

**Benefits:** It's simple and easy to reason about!

## Solution 2: Using the prototype chain

Store the ```increment``` function in just one object and have the interpreter, if it
doesn't find the function on ```user1```, look up to that object to check if it's there

Link ```user1``` and ```functionStore``` so the interpreter, on not finding ```.increment```, makes
sure to check up in ```functionStore``` where it would find it

Make the link with ```Object.create()``` technique

```javascript
function userCreator (name, score) {
 const newUser = Object.create(userFunctionStore);
 newUser.name = name;
 newUser.score = score;
 return newUser;
};

const userFunctionStore = {
 increment: function(){this.score++;},
 login: function(){console.log("Logged in");}
};

const user1 = userCreator("Will", 3);
const user2 = userCreator("Tim", 5);
user1.increment();
```


```Object.create()``` argument is always the ```__proto__``` property.

When you execute ```increment``` method on user, inside whats the code ```this.score++``` - What is it?

We need this method ```increment``` working on any user, user1,user2, .. user405.

We have amazing thing called ```implicit parameter``` that means, I don't even need to specify its one that's automatically there and filled in for me and it's called ```this```

Meaning, in execution context of increment in local memory I'll ```this``` label having user object

So ```this``` will store the object on which object its method called


## What if we want to confirm our user1 has the property score

```javascript
function userCreator (name, score) {
 const newUser = Object.create(userFunctionStore);
 newUser.name = name;
 newUser.score = score;
 return newUser;
};

const userFunctionStore = {
 increment: function(){this.score++;},
 login: function(){console.log("Logged in");}
};

const user1 = userCreator("Will", 3);
const user2 = userCreator("Tim", 5);
user1.hasOwnProperty('score') 
```

We can use the ```hasOwnProperty``` method - but where is it?

We can use the hasOwnProperty method - but where is it? Is it on ```user1```?

All objects have a ```__proto__``` property by default which defaults to linking to a big
object - ```Object.prototype``` full of (somewhat) useful functions

We get access to it via ```userFunctionStore‚Äôs __proto__ ``` property - the chain

### Solution 2: Using the prototype chain

**Problems:** No problems! It's beautiful. Maybe a little long-winded

Write this every single time - but it's 6 words!

```javascript

const newUser = Object.create(userFunctionStore);

...

return newUser

```

**Benefits:** Super sophisticated but not standard


## Solution 3 - Introducing the keyword that automates the hard work: ```new```

When we call the function that returns an object with new in front we automate 2
things
1. Create a new user object
2. Return the new user object

```javascript

const user1 = new userCreator("Eva",9);
const user2 = new userCreater('Tim',10);

```

But now we need to adjust how we write the body of userCreator - how can we:
- Refer to the auto-created object?
- Know where to put our single copies of functions?

### The new keyword automates a lot of our manual work

```javascript
function userCreator(name, score) {
 //const newUser = Object.create(functionStore);
  this.name = name;
  this.score = score;
};

functionStore userCreator.prototype // {};
functionStore userCreator.prototype.increment = function(){
 this.score++;
}

const user1 = new userCreator("Will", 3);
```

### Interlude - functions are both objects and functions ü§®

```javascript
function multiplyBy2(num){
 return num*2
}
multiplyBy2.stored = 5
multiplyBy2(3) // 6
multiplyBy2.stored // 5
multiplyBy2.prototype // {}

```
We could use the fact that all functions have a default property `prototype` on their object version, (itself an
object) - to replace our `functionStore` object


### The new keyword automates a lot of our manual work

```javascript
function userCreator(name, score){
 this.name = name;
 this.score = score;
}

userCreator.prototype.increment = function(){ this.score++; };
userCreator.prototype.login = function(){ console.log("login"); };

const user1 = new userCreator(‚ÄúEva‚Äù, 9)
user1.increment()
```

**Benefits:**

Faster to write. Often used in practice in professional code

**Problems:**

95% of developers have no idea how it works and therefore fail interviews

We have to upper case first letter of the function so we know it requires `new` to
work!

## Solution 4: The class ‚Äòsyntactic sugar'

We‚Äôre writing our shared methods separately from our object ```constructor``` itself
(off in the ```userCreator.prototype``` object)

Other languages let us do this all in one place. ES2015 lets us do so too

```javascript
class UserCreator {
 constructor (name, score){
 this.name = name;
 this.score = score;
 }
 increment (){ this.score++; }
 login (){ console.log("login"); }
}

const user1 = new UserCreator("Eva", 9);
user1.increment();
```

Solution 4: The class ‚Äòsyntactic sugar‚Äô

```javascript
class UserCreator {

 constructor (name, score){   //    function userCreator(name, score){
    this.name = name;         //        this.name = name;
    this.score = score;       //        this.score = score;
 }                            //    }
 increment (){ this.score++; }  // userCreator.prototype.increment = function(){ this.score++; };
 login (){ console.log("login"); } // userCreator.prototype.login = function(){ console.log("login"); };
}
const user1 = new UserCreator("Eva", 9);
user1.increment();

```

**Benefits:**

Emerging as a new standard
Feels more like style of other languages (e.g. Python)

**Problems:**

99% of developers have no idea how it works and therefore fail interviews
But you will not be one of them!
