// MongoDB allows us to have multiple Internal DB inside of a single mongo instance.

// In Mongodb creating the database isn't required.
// Databases & collections are created only when documents are first inserted.

// The behavior is consistent with the MongoDB's dynamic approach to data; just as the structure of documents need not be defined in advance, individual collections & databases can be created at runtime.


// Mongodb stores its information in documents, rather than rows which can be printed out in JSON. 
{
    _id : 10,
    name :"ashu",
    email : 'test@test.com'
}

// Group of documents called collection. Same as table in RDBMS.
