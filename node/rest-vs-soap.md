## REST API Vs SOAP

### What is an API (Application Programming Interface)?

**APIs just allow applications to communicate with one another.**

In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined **methods** of **communication** between various software components.‚Äù

The architecture of your API's are defined using SOAP or REST.

## REST (Representational State Transfer):

REST is an architectural style of web services that serves as a channel of communication between different systems (computers/services) over the Internet.

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that are backed by the architectural style of REST are referred to as REST APIs.

## SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

SOAP is a standard communication protocol system that permits processes using different OS (Linux and Windows} to communication over HTTP and its XML.

### Differences

* REST APIs uses multiple standards (HTTP, JSON, XML AND URL) while SOAP APIs is largely based on HTTP and XML

* REST APIs deploys multiple standards that makes it take fewer resources and bandwidth while SOAP APIs which uses XML for payload creation makes it result in large sized file.

* REST APIs require the use of HTTP while SOAP APIs are language, platform and transport independent.

* REST API is more flexible while SOAP API is a more rigid set of messaging patterns
